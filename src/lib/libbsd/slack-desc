# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libbsd: libbsd - BSD compatibility layer
libbsd:
libbsd: This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD
libbsd: systems, and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it
libbsd: easier to port projects with strong BSD origins, without needing
libbsd: to embed the same code over and over again on each project.
