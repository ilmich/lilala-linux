# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libvorbis: Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
libvorbis: general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality 
libvorbis: (8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and 
libvorbis: variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis 
libvorbis: in the same competitive class as audio representations such as 
libvorbis: MPEG-4 (AAC), and similar to, but higher performance than MPEG-1/2 
libvorbis: audio layer 3, MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
