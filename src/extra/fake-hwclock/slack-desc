# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

fake-hwclock:
fake-hwclock: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
fake-hwclock: Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
fake-hwclock: driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
fake-hwclock: of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
fake-hwclock: at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
fake-hwclock: least close to realtime.
